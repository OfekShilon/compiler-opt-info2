A fork of jaredwy's https://github.com/jaredwy/compiler-opt-info, as it seemed unmaintained and a [bug](https://github.com/jaredwy/compiler-opt-info/issues/1) needed fixing.




Original readme:

Currently provides a stream transofmer for the output of a opt.yaml file from LLVM. 

See test/test.js for an example of how to use it. 

See types.ts for the output format (currently just matches the LLVM output).
